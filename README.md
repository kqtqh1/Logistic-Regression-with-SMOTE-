# Logistic-Regression-for-Predicting-Diabetes-with-SMOTE

This is a diabetes prediction built using the logistic regression model. It aims to predict whether a person has diabetes based on their medical details.
This serves as an introductory exercise to help me understand the fundamentals of machine learning, the mechanics of logistic regression, and how to evaluate the performance of models effectively.

The dataset contains 8 features such as pregnancy, glucose, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, and age. The target variable is 'Outcome', where 
'0' indicates the patient does not have diabetes and '1' indicates the patient has diabetes.

The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set/data. This dataset was originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.
